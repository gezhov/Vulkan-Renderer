# Vulkan-Renderer
This is a graphics renderer powered by Vulkan, which is being written mainly for educational and research purposes.

Due to my personal development of the project, I can ignore possible pull requests, but, if you really want
to point out some problem or give me advice, you can create a corresponding issue.
